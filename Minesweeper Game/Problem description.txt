Write a C program that includes the functions listed as follows:
clearField(.): Takes a 20x20 2-dimensional integer array that represents a minefield. The
 function must assign all elements to 0.
putMine(.): Takes a 20x20 2-dimensional integer array (minefield), and two integers row and
 column. The function must assign the element at [row,column] in the array to -1.
processField(.): Takes 20x20 2-dimensional integer array (minefield). In the minefield, -1
 represents a mine is placed at that location. The function must fill the
 elements other than the mines with the number of mines that the element is
 neighbor to (including diagonal neighbors).
printField(.): Takes 20x20 2-dimensional integer array (minefield). The function must print
 the field by printing '*' instead of '-1' for the mines.
main() : Creates a minefield, clears it by using clearField() and puts arbitrary number of mines to
 the minefield by using putMine() function. After that, the minefield must be processed and
 printed by using processField() and printField() functions.
Example: For a field of 4x4 first the following array is created.
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
Then some mines are put as follows.
0 0 -1 0
0 0 0 0
0 -1 0 0
0 0 0 -1
Then, after processing the field, it is as follows.
0 1 -1 1
1 2 2 1
1 -1 2 1
1 1 2 -1
Also, it is printed as follows.
0 1 * 1
1 2 2 1
1 * 2 1
1 1 2 *
