This is the classical example for Software Test books and courses.
Write a triangle program with a GUI or CLI (in any programming language) that accepts three integers, a, b, and c, as
input that represent the sides of a triangle.
The integers a, b, and c must satisfy the following conditions:
C1: 1 <= a <= 50
C2: 1 <= b <= 50
C3: 1 <= c <= 50
C4: a < b+c
C5: b < a+c
C6: c < a+b

If an input value fails any of the conditions C1, C2, or C3, the program notes this with an error message.

If values of a, b, and c satisfy conditions C1, C2, and C3, one of the four mutually exclusive outputs is given:

1. Equilateral.
2. Isosceles.
3. Scalene.
4. If any of conditions C4, C5, and C6 is not met, the program output is "Not a Triangle".

If and only if all three digits of a valid input are the same the program displays "equilateral"
If and only if any two of the digits of a valid input are the same the program displays "isosceles"
If and only if each digit of a valid input is different the program displays "scalene"
